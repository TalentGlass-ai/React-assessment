# React Take-Home Assignment

## Job Platform Company – Candidate Assessment

## 1. Conceptual Questions

**(Please answer each in 3–4 sentences.)**

**a.** What are React hooks, and how do they improve component logic compared to class-based components?
*Your answer:*

**b.** Explain how you would optimize rendering performance in a React app with a long list (e.g., hundreds of job postings).
*Your answer:*

**c.** Describe your preferred approach to managing form state and validation in React.
*Your answer:*

## 2. Core Coding Challenge

**Feature:** _Job Listing Board_

**Instructions:**

- Build a React app with the following features:
    - Fetch and display a list of jobs from a mock API
(Suggestion: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts or create your own mock data).
    - Each job "card" must show a **title**, **company**, and **location**.
    - Add a **search bar** to filter jobs by title or company in real time.
    - Each card should have a **"Save Job"** button. Saved jobs appear in a separate section ("Saved Jobs").
    - Ensure basic **responsive design**.

**Bonus:**

- Debounce the search input.
- Show loading and error UI states.
- Use context or reducer for global state management if beneficial.

**Deliverable:**

- Submit source code (GitHub link or ZIP).
- Write brief **setup instructions** below or in the README.

**Setup Instructions:**

## 3. Debugging Exercise

**Review and fix this React code:**

```jsx
function JobList({ jobs }) {
  const [search, setSearch] = useState('');
  return (
    <div>
      <input value={search} onChange={e => setSearch(e.target.value)} />
      <ul>
        {jobs.map(job => (
          <li>{job.title} at {job.company}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Identify at least two coding issues or best practices.**
**a.** What is wrong or could be improved?
*Your answer:*

**b.** Provide your improved code and explain your changes.

*Your improved code:*

*Explanation of changes:*
